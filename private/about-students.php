      This year I helped with our infographic and driving. This has been my third year as a driver. The last time we used a tank drive (2 years ago) I was on the servo so this is my first time driving a tank drivetrain. This year was very different for me while I was still a driver, I got to learn about marketing. I worked on our team's infographic flyer and sponsorship message.

      As an accomplice to the FIRST program for over 7 years now, I am proud to stand as our teams driving coach, assistant builder, and assistant programmer. I do my best to make sure everyone has all the materials they need to complete any task or project they are working on, and am always ready to help out with anything that may be troubling them. This team means a lot to me, and with time becoming limited as competition approached, I did my best to help make sure my teammates and their robot were ready. I’m a Junior at our school, and pursuing a life full of technology, computer science, and photo/cinematography.

      This year (my third year in FTC and my sixth year with FIRST), my role was the main programmer as the programmers from prior years had graduated. When I took on this role at first, I was expecting the process to be pretty easy considering I could use the OnBot Blocks programming. Though I had used the blocks programming language last year, there was still much I hadn’t known about, and learning those things was quite fun.

I also helped contribute to the building of the robot. I helped contribute to the design and building process of the drivetrain and multiple attachments on the robot.

I am in charge of sponsorship and keeping track of the parts that we order. I also help the team by keeping everyone on task and if they do not have a task I recommend something that they could do to help the team.  This year I also helped in the construction of the robot.

      Although I’ve previously done FLL, this is my first year in robotics. Since most of the team has worked together for multiple years, I decided I would feel more comfortable taking on a more fluid role and doing ‘grunt work’ for the team, which I feel is very important, and practical, as I don't have much knowledge of how to do more complex things. I also took on a slightly managerial roll with checking up on everyone's progress through the practice, reminding them of safety gear, and being suspiciously energetic through the practice.

      This is my first year being a part of the AC Aces, as well as an FTC team. During team practices, I helped assemble and disassemble pieces needed for the robot. I was not able to help in most practices because of afterschool conflicts such as sports and other programs. My teammates and coaches were very understanding and always made sure to involve me in an activity.
